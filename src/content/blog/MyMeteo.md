</div>


In this project, I developed a mobile application using Flutter that displays the current weather and forecasts for the upcoming days. The data is fetched in real-time through the **OpenWeatherMap API**, combining front-end development with external data management.

### Project Goals
**Discover APIs**: Understand what an API is and how to integrate it into a Flutter application.

**Handle JSON Data**: Extract, parse, and display structured data.

**Create a Responsive Interface**: Provide a clear and visually appealing display of weather information.

### Key Features
**Current Weather**: Temperature, conditions (sunny, cloudy, etc.).

**Upcoming Forecasts**: Detailed information for multiple days.

**Modern User Interface**: Adaptable to different screens and easy to navigate.

### Technologies Used
**Flutter**: Cross-platform development framework.

**Dart**: Programming language for application logic.

**OpenWeatherMap API**: Source of real-time weather data.

### Technical Details
This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of:
**REST API calls** to fetch live data.

**Managing states and the lifecycle of Flutter widgets**.

**Exception handling** for seamless error management during network operations.
