In this collaborative project, our team of four embarked on the challenge of developing a **modernized version of the classic R-Type game**, combining advanced C++ programming, game engine design, and multiplayer networking. This project was an incredible opportunity to explore the world of **networked video game development** and apply advanced development techniques in a real-world scenario.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to recreate **R-Type**, a legendary horizontal shoot-â€™em-up game, while introducing additional modern features, such as:<br>
\- **Multiplayer functionality**, allowing several players to join forces against the alien Bydos.<br>
\- A custom **game engine**, designed and implemented from scratch to manage game mechanics, graphics, and networking.<br><br>

This project was split into two main phases:<br>
1\. **Core Development**: Designing the game's architecture and delivering a working prototype.<br>
2\. **Feature Expansion**: Adding specialized components to enhance the prototype, based on the team's choices.<br><br>

### Project Features

1\. **Programming Language**: Entirely developed in **C++**.<br>
2\. **Build System**: Managed with **CMake**, allowing streamlined builds and dependency management.<br>
3\. **Networking**: Implemented a multi-threaded server and networked graphical client to enable seamless multiplayer gameplay.<br>
4\. **Game Engine**: Designed and built a modular game engine with reusable components for rendering, physics, and game logic.<br><br>

### Technical Details

#### **Game Design**
\- Reimagined R-Type's mechanics while maintaining the spirit of the original game.<br>
\- Added modern features like dynamic lighting, enhanced enemy AI, and online co-op gameplay.<br><br>

#### **Server-Client Architecture**
\- **Server**: Handles player connections, synchronizes game states, and manages interactions in real time.<br>
\- **Client**: Renders the game world, processes player input, and communicates seamlessly with the server.<br><br>

#### **Multithreading**
\- Leveraged multithreading to ensure smooth gameplay, handling tasks like networking, physics updates, and rendering concurrently.<br><br>

#### **Networking**
\- Implemented efficient communication protocols to minimize latency in multiplayer sessions.<br>
\- Designed the server to handle multiple players simultaneously while ensuring game state consistency.<br><br>

### Team Contributions

As a team of four, we divided responsibilities to leverage our individual strengths:<br>
\- **Game Engine Design**: Collaboratively built a modular architecture, with clear responsibilities for rendering, physics, and input handling.<br>
\- **Server Implementation**: Developed a robust multi-threaded server capable of handling real-time gameplay.<br>
\- **Client Development**: Focused on the graphical interface and seamless interaction with the server.<br>
\- **Feature Enhancements**: Added advanced mechanics, such as co-op modes and improved enemy AI.<br><br>

### Key Learnings

This project provided us with valuable insights into:<br>
\- Designing and implementing a **custom game engine**.<br>
\- Developing efficient **networking solutions** for real-time applications.<br>
\- Managing concurrency with **multi-threading** in a game context.<br>
\- Practicing **collaborative software development** using version control and agile methodologies.<br><br>

### Challenges Faced

\- **Synchronizing Game States**: Ensured consistency between the server and clients, even in the presence of latency.<br>
\- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized multithreaded processes to maintain high frame rates and responsiveness.<br>
\- **Game Balancing**: Tuned enemy behavior and difficulty to provide an engaging experience for players.<br><br>

### Results

The project culminated in a fully functional multiplayer game featuring:<br>
\- **Smooth online gameplay**, where players team up to combat waves of enemies.<br>
\- **Visually appealing graphics**, with dynamic animations and effects.<br>
\- A solid foundation for extending the game engine for future projects.<br><br>
